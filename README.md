This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [https://react-ui-snowy.vercel.app/](https://react-ui-snowy.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contributing

If you want your package to be featured on the website, you can open a PR or send me an email via [chimezieinnocent39@gmail.com](mailto:chimezieinnocent39@gmail.com). Additionally, you can create a PR to suggest a feature to be added.

## Updates

The library will be updated on the go. Furthermore, soon, users will be able to see how each UI component library looks on the website without having to go to the library's documentation or website. That way, the main aim of this website (centralization) will be achieved.
